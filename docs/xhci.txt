xhci_init()
will initalize the controller, you do not need to mess with this
as it is reserved.


xhci_reset() will preform a Host Controller Reset.
When software uses this function, the Host Controller resets 
it's internal pipelines, timers,
counters, state machines, etc. to their initial value. Any 
transaction currently in progress on the
USB is immediately terminated.
