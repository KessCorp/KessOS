# KessOS

You will always know what it's doing.<br>
KessOS streams stuff that is
happening in the background.<br>

## Things that will be added.<br>

* Full USB support.
* More hardware support.
* PS/2 drivers.
* Support for more USB hosts.
* Optional GUI.
* Networking.

## Let me know what else to add! (Things that vanish from this list have been completed).<br>

### Please note that these will not be implemented right away as they take time.<br>

Just a notice, for some reason it WILL NOT work on a virtual machine and only hardware, we are currently working on this issue.
For now if you want to test it, just take out a USB and boot it on some hardware.
