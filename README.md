# KessOS

## Funky things happen on Qemu when running this.<br>
## People have the best experience on hardware.


You will always know what it's doing.<br>
KessOS streams stuff that is
happening in the background.<br>

## Things that will be added.<br>

* Full USB support.
* More hardware support.
* PS/2 drivers.
* A shell.
* System/Application operation logs (so you know what it is doing).
* Support for more USB hosts.
* Optional GUI.
* Networking.


### Please note that these will not be implemented right away as they take time.<br>

## Let me know what else to add! (Things that vanish from this list have been completed).<br><br>

## In order to interact with KessOS before we implement USB drivers, read below.<br>

You will need a system that emulates USB devices as PS/2 devices, or you will need a system with PS/2 ports and a PS/2 keyboard.


## Demo on real hardware.
